today,the tasks I completed are:
1.Memorize eighty words,
2.Finish the revision points of the VP of the department,
3.Communitate tomorrow's tasks with members of the group, 
4.Record the revision suggestions proposed by the leader,and revise tomorrow,
besides,today I spend time  browsing articles about computer knowledge.
On the other hand,not to do successful things,but to do meaningful things,and I was struck by this sentense.
