today,the tasks I completed are:
1.Memorize eighty words,
2.Finish the revision points of the VP of the department,
3.Communitate tomorrow's tasks with members of the group, 
4.Record the revision suggestions proposed by the leader,and revise tomorrow,
besides,today I spend time  browsing articles about computer knowledge.
On the other hand,not to do successful things,but to do meaningful things,and I was struck by this sentense.
To a certain extent, I have lost this friend, but I still don't give up. I hope that one day in the future this conflict will be reconciled, but I can still feel the gradual alienation of my friend.

Maybe it's because I think too much,and do too little,so I am anxious,let go and do it,complete the daily tasks seriously,and at he end of the quarter, you will thank yourself for your hard work.
