Dear Michael,
    As one of my closest friends,I'm writing the letter in order to recommend one of my favorite movies to you--Around the World in Eighty Days.

    The primary factors for my recommendation are as follows. For one thing,this is a science fiction movie which tells us an exciting story about an English gentleman,Mr.Phileas Fogg,who makes a bet with his clubmates and managers that he can travel around the world in eighty days. For another,it gives us a vivid description of the many difficulties and incidents which happen on his journey.

    Hope you watch and enjoy the movie. Looking forward to your reply.
                                                                Yours,
                                                                Li Ming
