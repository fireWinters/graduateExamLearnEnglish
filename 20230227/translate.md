世界癌症日：缩小护理差距
2023 年 2 月 4 日 陈述 东南亚
世卫组织东南亚区域主任 Poonam Khetrapal Singh 博士

在世界癌症日，世卫组织呼吁在整个东南亚区域加强行动，以加强卫生系统，以预防和及早发现癌症，提供及时的治疗转诊，增加获得姑息治疗的机会，并缩小在获得癌症治疗方面的差距。优质癌症服务——今年纪念活动的主题。 

癌症是全球第二大死因，2020 年估计有 990 万人死亡。2010 年至 2019 年间，全球癌症发病率增加了 26%，癌症死亡人数增加了 21%。据估计，全球三分之一的癌症死亡是由于吸烟、高体重指数、饮酒、水果和蔬菜摄入量低以及缺乏身体活动造成的。 

在世卫组织东南亚区域，2020 年估计有 230 万人患上癌症，140 万人死于该病。据估计，癌症占该地区非传染性疾病 (NCD) 过早死亡的 20% 以上，每年约有 470 万人死于非传染性疾病。2020 年，肺癌、乳腺癌和宫颈癌占该地区癌症相关死亡总人数的 40 万人，近三分之二被诊断患有癌症的人死于该病，凸显迫切需要改善早期治疗诊断和治疗。 

自 2014 年以来，该地区加快了预防、检测、治疗和控制癌症的行动，更加重视消除宫颈癌这一公共卫生问题。该地区的八个国家现已建立了以人口为基础的癌症登记处（PCBR），三个国家——缅甸、尼泊尔和斯里兰卡——是解决儿童癌症问题的重点国家。该地区 11 个成员国中有 10 个提供癌症诊断和治疗的三级医疗服务——包括手术和化疗服务——还有 9 个还提供放射治疗服务。 

世卫组织继续支持该区域各国实施其新的《2022-2030年口腔卫生区域行动计划》，包括口腔癌，2020年口腔癌是五大最常见癌症之一，占新发癌症的7.4%。该区域五个国家-不丹、印度、缅甸、斯里兰卡和泰国-现已制定了国家癌症控制计划，马尔代夫和尼泊尔正在最后确定该计划。该区域目前有望实现世卫组织非传染性疾病全球行动计划的目标，即在2010年至2025年期间将烟草使用流行率相对降低30%。

在宫颈癌方面，该地区正在取得快速、挽救生命的进展。五个成员国——不丹、马尔代夫、缅甸、斯里兰卡和泰国——已经在全国范围内实施 HPV 疫苗接种，孟加拉国、印度和东帝汶也将实施。印度尼西亚已在多个省份开展了 HPV 疫苗接种，覆盖了数千万女孩。新的证据表明，单剂 HPV 疫苗可提供与 2 剂程序相当的保护，加上额外的成本降低，应使各国能够覆盖到每一位妇女和女童。 

为了加快进展并缩小护理差距，该地区有几个优先事项。首先，在预防宫颈癌的常规免疫中引入和/或扩大 HPV 疫苗接种，至少覆盖 90% 的青春期少女。与此同时，该地区必须继续促进健康的生活方式，包括不仅立法而且执行关键的烟草控制措施，例如健康警告和禁止烟草广告、促销和赞助，以及提高烟草产品的税收。    

其次，提高初级卫生保健 (PHC) 级别的能力以及早发现癌症，重点是加强卫生人力培训、改善基础设施和资源以及简化转诊途径以迅速开始治疗。在所有国家/地区，PHC 医生和护士必须具备在社区内靠近患者住所和家人的地方提供姑息治疗和临终关怀的能力。  

第三，迅速且系统地提高三级医疗机构提供全面诊断和治疗服务的能力，这对于降低癌症死亡率至关重要。干预措施应针对具有高治愈潜力的高负担癌症。它们必须对所有人开放。应改进现有的 PBCR，并在适当的情况下建立新的登记册，确保决策者能够获得高质量的信息来规划、监测和评估干预措施，并相应地进行调整。  

第四，将癌症服务纳入风险分担或预付费计划和健康福利计划。为此，国家卫生预算应提高公共部门服务的质量和可及性，并加强财政保护，重点是结束灾难性的卫生支出。 

行动不能也不能等待。在过去的二十年里，世界在癌症控制科学方面取得了重大进展。然而，需要做更多的工作来缩小护理差距，提高癌症存活率，并加速实现 2025 年非传染性疾病目标和 2030 年可持续发展目标。在世界癌症日，世卫组织重申其承诺支持该区域所有国家预防、检测、治疗和控制癌症，确保每个地方的每个人都能公平获得优质的癌症服务。

World Cancer Day: Close the care gap
4 February 2023 Statement SEARO
by Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia

On World Cancer Day, WHO is calling for intensified action across the South-East Asia Region to strengthen health systems to prevent and detect cancers early, to provide prompt treatment referral, to enhance access to palliative care, and to close the gap in access to quality cancer services – the theme of this year’s commemoration. 

Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.9 million deaths in 2020. Between 2010 and 2019, global cancer incidence increased by 26%, alongside a 21% increase in cancer deaths. An estimated one third of cancer deaths globally are due to tobacco use, high body mass index, alcohol use, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack of physical activity. 

In the WHO South-East Asia Region, an estimated 2.3 million people developed cancer in 2020, and 1.4 million died of the disease. Cancer is estimated to account for more than 20% of premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the Region, which stand at around 4.7 million deaths every year. In 2020, cancer of the lungs, breast and cervix accounted for 400 000 of the total number of cancer-related deaths in the Region, and almost two-thirds of people diagnosed with cancer succumbed to the disease, highlighting the urgent need for improved early diagnosis and treatment. 

Since 2014, the Region has accelerated action to prevent, detect, treat and control cancer, with increased focus on eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem. Eight countries of the Region now have in place population-based cancer registries (PCBRs), and three countries – Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka – are focus countries for addressing childhood cancer. Ten of the Region’s 11 Member States provide tertiary care services for cancer diagnosis and treatment – including surgical and chemotherapy services – and nine also offer radiotherapy services. 

WHO continues to support countries of the Region to implement its new Regional Action Plan on Oral Health 2022–2030, including oral cancers, which in 2020 were among the top five most common cancers, accounting for 7.4% of new cancers. Five countries of the Region – Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand – now have in place national cancer control plans, which Maldives and Nepal are in the process of finalizing. The Region is currently on track to achieve the WHO NCD Global Action Plan target of a 30% relative reduction in tobacco use prevalence between 2010 and 2025. 

On cervical cancer, the Region is achieving rapid, life-saving progress. Five Member States – Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand – have introduced nation-wide HPV vaccination, which Bangladesh, India and Timor-Leste are set to also introduce. Indonesia has introduced HPV vaccination in several provinces, covering tens of millions of girls. New evidence shows that a single dose of HPV vaccine delivers protection comparable to the 2-dose schedule, which alongside additional cost reductions, should enable countries to reach every woman and girl. 

To accelerate progress and close the care gap, the Region has several priorities. First, introducing and/or expanding HPV vaccination in routine immunization to prevent cervical cancer, covering at least 90% of adolescent girls. At the same time, the Region must continue to facilitate healthy lifestyles, including by not just legislating but enforcing key tobacco control measures such as health warnings and bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, as well as by raising taxes on tobacco products.    

Second, increasing capacity at the primary health care (PHC) level to detect cancers early, with a focus on intensified health workforce training, improved infrastructure and resources, and streamlined referral pathways for prompt initiation of treatment. In all countries, PHC physicians and nurses must be equipped to provide palliative and end-of-life care close to patients’ homes and families, within the community.  

Third, rapidly – and systematically – advancing the capacity of tertiary care facilities to provide comprehensive diagnostic and treatment services, which is critical to reduce cancer mortality. Interventions should be aimed at high-burden cancers with high potential for cure. They must be accessible to all. Existing PBCRs should be improved, and where appropriate, new registries established, ensuring that policy makers can access good quality information to plan, monitor and evaluate interventions, and adjust accordingly.  

Fourth, including cancer services in risk pooling or pre-payment schemes and health benefit packages. For this, national health budgets should enhance the quality and accessibility of public sector services and strengthen financial protection, with a focus on ending catastrophic health expenditure. 

Action cannot and must not wait. In the last two decades, the world has made significant progress in the science of cancer control. However, much more work is needed to close the care gap, improve cancer survival, and accelerate towards the NCD 2025 and Sustainable Development Goal targets 2030. On World Cancer Day, WHO reiterates its commitment to support all countries of the Region to prevent, detect, treat and control cancer, ensuring equitable access to quality cancer services for everyone, everywhere.
