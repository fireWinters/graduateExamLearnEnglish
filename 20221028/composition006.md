Dear Professor Williams, 

 I am extremely honored to accept your invitation to give a presentation to a host of foreign students on Chinese culture. 
 Here are the key points of my presentation. First of all, compared with Westerners,the Chinese people have tradditionally paid more attention to the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature.'Nature and man are one' is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology. In addition, in Chinese traditional thought,much emphasis is laid upon moral cultivation,the refinement of temper, and the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon logical reasoning.
 My appreciation to you for your invitation is beyond words. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. 
 Your sincerely,
 Li Ming.
