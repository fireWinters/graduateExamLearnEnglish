### 原文

Dear Sir or Madam,

I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st,but using it for a short period of time ,I found is has some problems.

To begin with,the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day.In additon, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.

Therefre,I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. Your help is greatly appreciated.

                                                    Yours sincerely,
                                                    Zhang Wei
